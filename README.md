# GRD-Nearby-Statement
Heurisic to locate a gamma-ray burst on the unit sphere. The main file is rough_approximation.m, that calcultaes a guess
g and returns the angular error between g and the actual location of the bursts.

We use the data from events.txt to generate our guess. This data is from a physics simulation at Washington University in St. Louis.
Please read full documentation to have an idea of the original dataset.
